analysis   | Description of the methods and some preliminary analyses that I redid (in 2017, 14 years after the experiments)
data       | Data files and description
experimental_code | The C code that ran the experiments. You likely won't be able to compile these, but they contain critical information about the methods. If for some reason you'd like to compile the code, contact Jeff Rouder (rouderj@missouri.edu) for the libraries
info       | A copy of the thesis (sorry about the terrible writing; it was my first scientific effort) and other information, including figures I extracted from the text for convenience
